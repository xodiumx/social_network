# How it works

### Registation and authentication endpoints
```
- auth/jwt/login (POST)
- auth/jwt/logout (POST)
- auth/jwt/register (POST)
```
- The client sends a `POST` request to the endpoint `auth/jwt/register` in the form
```
{
  "email": "maks@example.com",
  "password": "maks1234",
  "is_active": true,
  "is_superuser": false,
  "is_verified": false
}
```
- Fields `is_active`, `is_superuser`, `is_verified` - are changed to default during data processing
- Next, the client enters authorization data *email* and *password* by endpoint `/auth/jwt/login` and receives JWT - token which is stored in `cookie`
- on the `/post` endpoint all CRUD operations are available
- To create a like, the user sends a post request to the `/like` endpoint
- And for delete like, delete request to the `/like_remove` endpoint, same with dislikes

### Detailed documentation is available at the endpoint `/docs`
